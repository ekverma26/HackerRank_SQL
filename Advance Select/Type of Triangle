Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Equilateral: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths. Input Format
The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input 
------------
A  B  C  
20 20 23 
20 20 20  
20 21 22  
13 14 30

Sample Output
-------------
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle

Query:-
SELECT  CASE
    WHEN A+B>C AND B+C>A AND A+C>B THEN
        CASE 
            WHEN A=B AND B=C THEN 'Equilateral'
            WHEN A=B or A=C OR B=C THEN 'Isosceles'
            ELSE 'Scalene'
        END
    ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
END
FROM TRIANGLES ;
