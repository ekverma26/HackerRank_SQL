Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard’s 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format
The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

Column	Type
ID	Integer
NAME	String
Salary	Integer
Note: Salary is measured in dollars per month and its value is < 105.

Sample Input

ID	Name	Salary
1	Kristeen	1420
2	Ashley	2006
3	Julia	2210
4	Maria	3000
Sample Output

2061

Explanation
The table below shows the salaries without zeroes as they were entered by Samantha:

ID	Name	Salary
1	Kristeen	142
2	Ashley	26
3	Julia	221
4	Maria	3
Samantha computes an average salary of 98.00. The actual average salary is 2159.00.
The resulting error between the two calculations is 2159.00 - 98.00 = 2061.00 which, when rounded to the next integer, is 2061.


QUERY:-
SELECT CEIL(AVG(SALARY)-AVG(REPLACE(SALARY,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;
