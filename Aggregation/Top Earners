We define an employee’s total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as space-separated integers.

Input Format
The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

Column	Type
employee_id	Integer
name	String
months	Integer
salary	Integer
where employee_id is an employee’s ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they’ve been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.

Sample Input

employee_id	name	months	salary
12228	Rose	15	1968
33645	Angela	1	3443
45692	Frank	17	1608
56118	Patrick	7	1345
59725	Lisa	11	2330
74197	Kimberly	16	4372
78454	Bonnie	8	1771
83565	Michael	6	2017
98607	Todd	5	3396
99989	Joe	9	3573
Sample Output

69952 1

Explanation
The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram:

employee_id	name	months	salary	earnings
12228	Rose	15	1968	29520
33645	Angela	1	3443	3443
45692	Frank	17	1608	27336
56118	Patrick	7	1345	9415
59725	Lisa	11	2330	25630
74197	Kimberly	16	4372	69952
78454	Bonnie	8	1771	14168
83565	Michael	6	2017	12102
98607	Todd	5	3396	16980
99989	Joe	9	3573	32157
The maximum earnings value is 69952. The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $69952 (which is 1) as two space-separated values.


QUERY:-
SELECT * FROM (SELECT MONTHS*SALARY, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY MONTHS*SALARY ORDER BY MONTHS*SALARY DESC) WHERE ROWNUM=1;
