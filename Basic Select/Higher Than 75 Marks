Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
STUDENTS table has following columns:

ID , NAME , MARKS

Sample input:

id         name     marks
1          ashley   81
2          samantha 75
3          julia    76
4          belvet   84
Sample output:

Ashley
Julia
Belvet
Explanation:

Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have marks > 75. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.

QUERY:-
SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS WHERE MARKS>75 ORDER BY SUBSTR(NAME,-3, LENGTH(NAME)), ID ;
